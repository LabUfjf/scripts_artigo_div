% Sheather and Jones(1991) bandwidth selection for kernel density estimation.

% Reference: Wand and Jones (1995) pp.74-75, see also appendix C for calculation helps
% with normal densities.

%Note, this function was originally based on a function bandwidth_SJ, written by
%Taesam Lee, that was downloaded from the MATLAB file exchange.  But it has been 
%changed the point that it doesn't resemble the original any more.  Most
%importantly:
% - using only the normal case, removed 2nd argument.
% - replaced symbolic computation with numeric approximation (it is faster this way).
